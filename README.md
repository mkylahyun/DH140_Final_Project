# DH140_Final_Project

## Data and viz of interest
> I looked into a journal article that relates data science to a humanities topic of interest, human behavior. I also included an image of a data visualization I would like to know how to make with Python.

Data science and human behavior interests me because humans are complex and analyzing with data can help us to further understand human behaviors, which can provide different ways to improve or help ourselves.

I would love to know how to make this data visualization with Python because it is clean, aesthetically pleasing, and easy to understand. 

## Ideas for data to investigate 
> I've listed below some humanities topics of interest and link to data/articles that relate to those topics. 

* Whether digital technology provides a better life
* How modern gadgets influence people's mental heatlh
* Why social media make people feel lonely as opposed to connected

The topic on data visualization appeals to me the most because I am a big visual learner and find it interesting how putting data in visual contexts can help to understand or uncover patterns/trends.

## Ideas from curated datasets & project lists
> I reviewed projects and datasets and made a table that includes the name of dataset of interest, a brief description of the data and how I might investigate it in a project, and the link to the data.

Name | Description | Link 
:--- | :---------- | :---
Adult | Census income dataset to predict whether income exceeds $50k a year. Might invesitigate how attributes such as education or gender affect income. | https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.data
World Values | Survey data investigating changing values and their impact on social and political life. Might investigate by analyzing what factors are taken into account when creating beliefs and values. | https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSDocumentationWV7.jsp
