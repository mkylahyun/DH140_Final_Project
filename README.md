## Project Background
Music exists in all cultures and societies, and many share the appreciation of music through active streaming of songs by varying countries with even different languages. But how do they differ and are there any underlying behavioral patterns that are represented by popular music in the different cultures? 

### Do popular songs differ by countries of varying happiness and depression scores?
### Is there a relationship between audio feature trends and levels of happiness/depression? 

> The objective of this project is to see whether there is a **relationship between country's happiness or depression score, and the songs that are popular in each respective group**. To address this question, I assess audio featuers for each country's top playlist and compare audio feature trends for countries with high happiness score, low happiness score, high prevalence of depression, and low prevalence of depression. 

The Top Songs Playlist for each country is collected through scraping Spotify's API data and is pre-processed to include the playlists and relevant audio features of interest for each. The World Happiness data is sourced from the [World Happiness Report 2022](https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2022/#appendices-and-data) and the World Depression data is sourced from [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/depression-global-health-estimates). The two datasets are pre-processed to include features of interests: happiness scores and prevalence of depression. All three were also cleaned to include only countries that are present in all three data sets for cohesiveness.
